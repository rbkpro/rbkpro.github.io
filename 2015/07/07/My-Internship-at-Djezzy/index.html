        <h2 id="About-Djezzy"><a href="#About-Djezzy" class="headerlink" title="About Djezzy:"></a>About Djezzy:</h2><p>Djezzy is one of the leader service provider for mobile companies in Algeria. The company was founded on July 11, 2001 It is based in Algiers the capital of Algeria. It has been proven to be a successful company because it has an annual turnover of $ 1.43 billion in 2014.<br>With the advent of modern technologies, Djezzy also incorporate their customers with new applications and ideas. They have well trained professionals to develop software and meet the customers demand, with the huge support of developers. Djezzy move toward emphasis the newer technologies like Mobile application development.<br>I was lucky to get the opportunity to complete my internship at Djezzy, Since Djezzy is a leading mobile service provider and the number 2 provider of broadband Internet services in Algeria, I consider myself very fortunate to take a deep look into their development methods and working models.</p>
<h2 id="The-Story"><a href="#The-Story" class="headerlink" title="The Story:"></a>The Story:</h2><p>I worked on a project called Carpooling. It is a carpooling system that provide city-to-city travel in Algeria. Carpooling allows you to search, find and book the appropriate way to travel between different cities. It’s similar to BlaBla car in Europe. My specific task was to develop its application for Android devices, regardless of my background with the programing language Java.</p>
<h3 id="My-task-was"><a href="#My-task-was" class="headerlink" title="My task was:"></a>My task was:</h3><ul>
<li>Understand the project.</li>
<li>Develop Android application using Android Studio.</li>
<li>Connect the application with the backend API.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Problems"><a href="#Problems" class="headerlink" title="Problems"></a>Problems</h3><p>Various issues and problems were encountered in the task of building the project, the three big problem I found were:<br>First, the limited interaction between the team, even though we were using emails and Microsoft team collaboration solution (Exchange).<br>Second, ensure that the different releases could be integrated.<br>Third, the lack of electronic payments using Algerian Banks.<br>Beside these problems I picked carefully the right technologies and tools. I developed a RESTFull web services that provide a JSON endpoints, the endpoints allowed us to develop several application using different technologies and keep the interaction with the system through a high level abstraction layer.<br>The Android application built on top of the Carpooling API (endpoints).<br>Regardless of the payments issue we came up with another way of payment using SIM credit card as another option.</p>
<h3 id="Achievements"><a href="#Achievements" class="headerlink" title="Achievements"></a>Achievements</h3><p>One of the important achievements of this project was the development of a new programming API which provided many features. The major benefits of this API are:   </p>
<ul>
<li>It greatly simplifies the interaction and the connection with any mobile app (whether it’s IOS app or Android app) and with web applications, because it’s a JSON endpoints.</li>
<li>It stores and retrieves data in a lightweight database (MySql DB).</li>
<li>It is scalable and maintainable, therefore developed on top of Java EE stack.</li>
<li>It is very secure thanks to the authentication and the encrypted payment methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end of the internship a beta version of the application was finally developed using this API, this version doesn’t contain all of the features that are planned for the final version, but likely to contain a number of known and unknown bugs.</p>
<h3 id="Appreciation"><a href="#Appreciation" class="headerlink" title="Appreciation"></a>Appreciation</h3><p>In the other side, during my internship I was working in pretty and small cube that was attached to the IT department, the department had a workforce of 50 employees, the stuff at Djezzy and employees that I worked with were very helpful and extended their valuable guidance and help whenever required for the projects which I worked on.<br>Overall, the team made my stay at Djezzy an enjoyable one and I was grateful to them for making it so.<br>To me this was an ideal working environment that I wished to continue working with, unfortunately it wasn’t a Pre-employment training. </p>
